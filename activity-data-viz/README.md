# Activity Log Data Visualization

We have a ton of data in the activity log which isn't being used very well. The point of this plugin is to
add sort of like a "summary view" of the activity on a given mural. 

Some improvements would include:
1. Narrowing activity based on
    a. a given time range
    b. a specific user (for performance reasons, would likely require changes to the API)
    c. look for a specific action (same as above)
2. Add a "fech next page" button instead of an automatic exhaust pagination strategy
